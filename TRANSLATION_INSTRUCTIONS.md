# Translation Instructions

Thank you for helping translate Musivault! Your contributions make this project accessible to more people around the world.

## How to Translate

1.  **Context Matters**: We try to provide context keys (e.g., `button.save`, `header.welcome`). If a string is ambiguous, please leave a comment or check the "Source string location" link if available.
2.  **Variables**: You might see variables like `{{name}}` or `{{count}}`. **Do not translate these variables**; keep them exactly as they are in the translated string.
    *   *English*: "Hello {{name}}"
    *   *French*: "Bonjour {{name}}"
3.  ** HTML/Tags**: Some strings might contain HTML tags like `<strong>` or `<br/>`. Please preserve them in your translation to maintain formatting.
4.  **Tone**: Please maintain a friendly and professional tone.

## Glossary
*   **Release**: Refers to a music album/single/EP.
*   **Master**: Refers to the "master release" concept from Discogs (the abstract representation of an album).
